# Cook County Jail inmate tracker

A Django app that tracks the population of Cook County Jail over time
and summarizes trends.

# Using the API

See the [API guide](https://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail/wiki/API-guide)
for accessing the production API service and querying the data.

# Setting up for local development

After you've checked out the source code repository, you need to install the requirements. You are strongly encouraged
to create a [virtual environment](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) before installing them. 

To install the requirements, you should have `[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)` installed. If you made a virtual environment, this is already done for you.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

By default, the locally running application uses the `[sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/)` database, which is often already installed on modern operating systems. Assuming you have it available, you may now initialize the application database:

    ./manage.py syncdb --noinput
    ./manage.py migrate countyapi

# Running the scraper locally

Once you've set up the database, you need to run the scraper to populate the database with records.
The scraper is invoked with a management command:

    ./manage.py scrape_inmates

<code>scrape_inmates</code> also supports a <code>--limit / -l</code>
flag which limits the number of records created and <code>--search /
-s</code> flag which overrides the default A-Z search strategy. 

# Cloning the database

If you'd like to copy all of the data that this project has scraped into your local database, you can run this command. It takes a while!

    ./manage.py clone_db

# Running the API server locally

    ./manage.py runserver
    
You'll be able to use a browser to go to `http://localhost:8000` where you'll see the welcome page, or to `http://localhost:8000/api/1.0/?format=json` to see that the API is basically functional.
